It may not be very clever to be effective but it should contain your key message.\u00a0If your key message contains an image is it bold and memorable. Is your event title clear and catchy.<\/p>\n<p>Try testing your publicity out on friends. Ask them does the text and image grab their attention?\u00a0Get their feedback and advice. Maybe show them a few versions and ask them which one they like best.<\/p>\n<h2>Broadcast on all Channels<\/h2>\n<p>As part of our workshop we asked students to vote on the channels of publicity that influenced them the most on if to attend events or not.\u00a0While social media, Twitter, Facebook etc are a key cost effective way to communicate that something is happening, It became apparent that word of mouth is key. Posters and flyers reinforce a message and can fire the imagination creating an emotional connection in a way that tweets and status updates cannot. Stalls which draw people in can be a good way of recruiting for an event that requires more commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Our advice is to try different channels of communication and to evaluate which are the most effective. Transmit signals on all channels and see what bounces back!<\/p>\n<h2>Have a plan B<\/h2>\n<p>Just that really. What happens if your publicity drive does not get the response you want? As long as you don&#8217;t leave it to the last minute, it gives you a chance to try a Plan B. Maybe you change the look of your publicity, the title, the venue, even the audience.<\/p>\n<p>If Primary Schools are hard to reach, what about Home Education groups? If there is no response for doing an after-school session what about one in the holidays?<\/p>\n<p>Did your publicity slogan not catch on? Try a poster with a Duck going skiing on it?<\/p>\n<h2>Communication is Key<\/h2>\n<p>First of all double\u00a0check simple things. Make sure every bit of publicity has\u00a0clear\u00a0communication about things like location, time, date, cost (if it is free say so) \u00a0what the workshop is and how it is for.<\/p>\n<p>Have everything confirmed with partners 3 weeks in advance. Create a publicity strategy with them and work together to roll it out all at once and stay in good contact when that is happening. 2 weeks before the event a good time to start ramping up the promotion.<\/p>\n<p>Last minute communication is also important. Send confirmations if they book on. Then 1 or 2 days before send a reminder with the key information and ask them to let you know if they can&#8217;t make it. Being in steady contact with your guests in a friendly and reassuring way is very important. Which bring us on to our last tip.<\/p>\n<h2>Be like a Swan<\/h2>\n<p>What we mean by this is to be persistent but not desperate when you are doing your promotion.\u00a0When we say\u00a0be like a Swan, on the surface you are elegant forward motion but under the surface you are working very hard paddling away.\u00a0People like to be part of confident project so when you are doing your promotion don&#8217;t seem too desperate to get people to come.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key things is to enjoy your event. \u00a0If you are having a good time and relaxed then it&#8217;s likely your guests will be too.<\/p>\n<h2>Summary<\/h2>\n<p>There are some great professional skills here about independence and flexibility as well as confidence building. As we prepared these tips and delivered the workshop we were sure to point out that this is all much easier to do in theory than in practice (especially the last tip!).<\/p>\n<p>Take things step by step and feel free to build your events up slowly as you gain confidence.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You have a fantastic, fun and new idea to bring to the world of Education, but how can you make sure that it gets the audience that it deserves?\u00a0In a world where media surrounds us, sometimes it can be tricky to get our message across to the right people.
