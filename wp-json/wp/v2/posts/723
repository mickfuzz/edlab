What skills does he or she require in a blended, ever-changing environment?<\/p>\n<p>This workshop focuses on developing meaningful digital skills to work in a playful and productive way. It is based on the premise that \u2018open\u2019 organisations are more innovative, efficient, and fun places to be within than their closed, bureaucratic counterparts.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Key Messages<\/h2>\n<p>Doug based this workshop around three key messages which he outlines <a href=\"http:\/\/literaci.es\/working-openly-a-manifesto\">fully in a blog post here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>He kindly outlined it for us with examples. The summary statements are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a corner of the web you control<\/li>\n<li>Work openly by default<\/li>\n<li>Ensure your data is readable by both humans and machines<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/EdLabMMU\/status\/672055619692666880<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Activities and Tools Used<\/h2>\n<h3>First the Tools&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Etherpad:<\/strong> One of the first tools used was <strong>etherpad<\/strong> which is a tool which makes it easy for many to collaborate on a piece of text. The space for collaboration is web page which has a text space called a &#8216;pad&#8217; which anyone can add text and links too, and a chat window.\u00a0The pad for this session is at the following address &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/workopen.org\/edlab\">http:\/\/workopen.org\/edlab<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>WordPress:<\/strong> A tool to create your own website or blog. It is a good first stem in getting a corner of the web that you control You can sign up for a free website at <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.com\">http:\/\/wordpress.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Trello:<\/strong>\u00a0An online to do list which allows you to create different ways or working openly with a team. Doug suggested to use it in a way that is very simple by creating three areas for your tasks.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To do: a list of tasks that need to be done and aren&#8217;t allocated yet<\/li>\n<li>Doing: tasks that are currently being done and who is doing them<\/li>\n<li>Done: move tasks to this area when they have been done to show your progress<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Google Docs:<\/strong> A way of collaborating on documents and asking people to comment on what you have written. It is a good way of sharing your work by default and allowing your partners to check you are on the right track.<\/p>\n<h3>But what about the activities..<\/h3>\n<p>Doug&#8217;s activities included the following which can be reused.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mingle Mesh<\/strong>: A full <a href=\"https:\/\/laura.makes.org\/thimble\/LTEyOTQ0MDE1MzY=\/mingle-mesh-creating-connections\">write up here from Laura.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Learners explore and discuss why connecting to other people is important. The facilitator should use this activity to help determine why learners want to connect and help them explore the benefits of connection in a guided discussion.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text\/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 25%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t<\/style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-2' class='gallery galleryid-723 gallery-columns-4 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0276.jpg' title=\"\" data-rl_title=\"\" class=\"rl-gallery-link\" data-rl_caption=\"\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-2\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0276-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0282.jpg' title=\"\" data-rl_title=\"\" class=\"rl-gallery-link\" data-rl_caption=\"\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-2\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0282-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0285.jpg' title=\"\" data-rl_title=\"\" class=\"rl-gallery-link\" data-rl_caption=\"\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-2\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0285-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0286.jpg' title=\"\" data-rl_title=\"\" class=\"rl-gallery-link\" data-rl_caption=\"\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-2\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0286-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><br style=\"clear: both\" \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spectrum Line:<\/strong> From\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.seedsforchange.org.uk\/tools#spectrumlines\">http:\/\/www.seedsforchange.org.uk\/tools#spectrumlines<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Start by creating an imaginary or real line through the room (chalk or masking tape on the floor are good for indoor spaces). One end stands for \u201cI agree completely\u201d, the other end for \u201cI disagree completely\u201d. Outline the issue under debate and formulate it into a statement to agree or disagree with. Ask people to position themselves along the line according to their views. They may try out several spots before making a final choice. Ask them to have a short conversation with the person next to them, explaining why they are where they are. Then invite participants to share their viewpoints and feelings with the group. Repeat this exercise with other statements that explore the issue under discussion and see whether and how people&#8217;s viewpoints change. You could also use a curved line so that people can see each other. This exercise taps into both our intuitive and rational sides and needs to be done quietly and thoughtfully. A spectrum line may require strong facilitation to stop the group from slipping into general discussion.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-height360 wp-image-746\" src=\"http:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0304-482x360.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0304\" width=\"482\" height=\"360\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strong Wind Blows:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unconference.net\/unconference-methods-a-strong-wind-blows\/\">Definition from Unconference.net<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The whole point is to support people being able to get to know one another and a sense of who in the room.\u00a0You start with a circle with the number of chairs for people minus one. You can be that person in the middle. This is like musical chairs sort of. The person in the middle says \u2013 \u2018a strong wind blows for Canadians\u2019 so all the people who are Canadian must get up \u2026 and run\/walk to a new chair. The person in the middle then is the person who says something true about themselves that is likely a quality, interest or skill that others in the group have \u2018a strong wind blows for ruby programmers\u2019 or \u2018a strong wind blows for make magazine subscribers\u2019 or anything else. This can go on for 10 min and is really fun. It helps identify common qualities and experiences in the room.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-height360 wp-image-736\" src=\"http:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/12\/IMG_0191-360x360.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0191\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We were very happy to welcome Doug Belshaw to facilitate a Creative Space as part of our EdLab series.
