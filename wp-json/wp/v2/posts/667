Now what do you do next? How do you change your ideas into reality?<\/p>\n<p>One of the problems about trying to manage a project is Murphy\u2019s Law which states that <strong>whatever can go wrong will go wrong<\/strong>. On the other hand the alternative of struggling ahead with no plan is clearly not a great alternative.\u00a0Another issue about planning systems is that they can take you away from what you are actually doing and draw you into a world of charts and timelines.<\/p>\n<p>To try to avoid these problems we can try an <strong>agile approach<\/strong> to project work. In this post I want to focus on a few features of being agile and look at a tool and simple framework that may help.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gantt_chart\">GANNT charts<\/a> which are often used by project managers to plan our projects years in advance.

Our advice here is to <strong>keep things simple<\/strong>.\u00a0In our model there are three main boxes where your tasks go, <strong>Current Sprint, Next Up and On Hold.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Current Sprint:<\/strong> these are tasks that need to happen by the next time you meet. Your sprint duration may be a week. It might get shorter as you get closer to the event and you need to meet up more often to get more done.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Next Up:<\/strong> The jobs which you know will need to be done next. These may be in order of priority to make sure you don&#8217;t get held up in the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On Hold:<\/strong> Tasks which you should be allocating now but for some reason are held up. This may be because you don&#8217;t have the information you need for example.<\/p>\n<h3>Breakdown your tasks<\/h3>\n<p>Especially in your sprint period every task should have an allocated person to lead on it even if it will be done by more than one person.<br \/>\nIf it makes sense then put down the day the job should be done.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Breakdown your bigger jobs into lots of little tasks.<\/strong> A task shouldn&#8217;t take longer than 15 min. If it does, then break it up into different ones. Can these different tasks be given out to more than one person?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keeping communication going<\/strong> is also a job so don&#8217;t forget to put down jobs like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ring around group to check status of tasks and that people have what they need<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Set a meeting time next Tues or Wed and invite everyone<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Make sure all tasks this sprint have\u00a0a person allocated<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text\/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t<\/style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-2' class='gallery galleryid-667 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/11\/trello_sheets_1.jpg' title=\"\" data-rl_title=\"\" class=\"rl-gallery-link\" data-rl_caption=\"\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-2\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/11\/trello_sheets_1-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/11\/trello_sheets_2.jpg' title=\"\" data-rl_title=\"\" class=\"rl-gallery-link\" data-rl_caption=\"\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-2\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/11\/trello_sheets_2-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/11\/trello_sheets_3.jpg' title=\"\" data-rl_title=\"\" class=\"rl-gallery-link\" data-rl_caption=\"\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-2\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/11\/trello_sheets_3-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><br style=\"clear: both\" \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n<h3>Be Flexible<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t fear the on hold box. Our approach to projects are all about adapting to what is happening. If something is On Hold then let&#8217;s use this as a way of finding out what we need to change to make our project go forward.<\/p>\n<p>There are two other boxes that can help us to move things out of the <strong>On Hold<\/strong> box. Maybe we need to look at our overall aims of the project. The <strong>Why, What, Who, Where and When<\/strong>. If we can&#8217;t make progress doing promotion, tt could be we need to change the audience. If there are things we don&#8217;t know about he venue maybe we need to do it in a different place.<\/p>\n<h3>Remember *you* are the project<\/h3>\n<p>An agile approach should focus on the people involved. <strong>It&#8217;s you as a group that have the ideas and skills that will solve your challenges<\/strong>. If your plan is distracting from that then take a step back. Have a conversation, have a cup of tea, have disputes but then find your common ground and agree to your tasks. Think of each task as a small step towards a greater goal<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it&#8217;s the only thing that ever has.<br \/>\nMargaret Mead<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You&#8217;ve come up with your project ideas, you know the Why, What, When, Who and Where.
