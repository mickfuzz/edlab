Investment in girls\u2019 education also has a multiplier effect: educated girls benefit from better family planning and have healthier children who are more likely to remain in education themselves. But Sierra Leonean girls are increasingly likely to drop out of school at this vital stage.\u00a0 As a charity working at the very forefront of educational development in the region, Street Child felt it was imperative to find out why.\u00a0So, we decided to ask them, and spoke to more than 2,000 adolescent girls across Sierra Leone to discuss the issues preventing them from going to school.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest barrier to education that the girls identified was poverty, but they also talked about teen pregnancy, parental pressures, and the need for better schools, teachers and social support.\u00a0 Street Child&#8217;s response is to make sure that girls are not just going to school but staying there.\u00a0 Our appeal will help a girl&#8217;s family create a secure business that will fund their education long into the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marie&#8217;s Case Study<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2016\/05\/1461757135471.jpeg\" data-rel=\"lightbox-image-1\" data-rl_title=\"\" data-rl_caption=\"\" title=\"\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1318 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2016\/05\/1461757135471.jpeg\" alt=\"1461757135471\" width=\"500\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2016\/05\/1461757135471.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2016\/05\/1461757135471-300x260.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s been two years since I was in school. My father and mother separated and she had no one to take care of us. We were struggling and things got difficult. I was forced to drop out of school.<\/p>\n<p>It was not that I am stupid. I came top in my class in the BECE [Sierra Leone\u2019s GCSE equivalent]. I wanted to be educated, I wanted to be a lawyer, it was my dream. But my father wouldn\u2019t support me and I had to leave school. What was I meant to do?<\/p>\n<p>I was selling small goods to help support my family. Other than that I had nothing to do. People could see I had nothing to occupy me. It was hard. Then I met a guy who said he would support me. I understood what he meant. I was 16 and he was 25.<\/p>\n<p>I came to have feelings for him. But that was because of what he was doing for me. He gave me hope. But I don\u2019t think he liked me. Eventually he got me pregnant but he denied that he was the father.\u00a0 I was betrayed.<\/p>\n<p>When I fell pregnant I just felt weak. I wasn\u2019t able to do hard work. I often fell over. My mother managed to get some money together to get me treatment, which helped me get through the pregnancy and then the delivery.<\/p>\n<p>My friends told me I was too young to have a child. And that my poverty had made it happen. That hurt me. I never said anything but I didn\u2019t ask for this. It was a mistake.<\/p>\n<p>Now I have a son. But things haven\u2019t changed much. I have a baby but there\u2019s no father to support us. I live with my mother but things are hard. Sometimes I have to ask my Auntie for money. I help my Grandmother sell food at the top of our road to get by.<\/p>\n<p>Education is important. When you\u2019re at school you have the chance to change your life. I believe if I become educated those who\u2019ve been talking down to me will have to change their views. I want people to look at me and say \u2018you\u2019ve turned out well\u2019.\u00a0 And If I could continue school I\u2019d want to become a lawyer. I want to defend people who can\u2019t defend themselves. I\u2019d want to make sure that people can get the rights that they deserve.<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could go back to school. But we just don\u2019t have the money for me to continue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For more information see:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.street-child.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.street-child.co.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UPzuPVx7Vso&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This is therefore an important educational project to support and we have opportunities for you to get involved via an EdLab challenge, or project.
