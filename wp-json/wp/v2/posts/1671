However, increasingly, printed books are being replaced with digital books downloaded on a reading device such as a tablet or Kindle, and in many families a quiet bedtime reading routine is becoming more akin to watching TV or playing a video game.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thersa.org\/contentassets\/5423b6a929fd4ef1bca12c337b1f87b2\/childrens-reading-on-screen-project-4802.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" \/><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Research shows that the reading format can significantly change the parent-child dynamics, with children being <a href=\"http:\/\/rer.sagepub.com\/content\/85\/4\/698.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more distracted<\/a>\u00a0and subsequently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0273229714000501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">learning less<\/a>\u00a0with the digital books rather than printed books. On the other hand, the digital format offers new exciting possibilities for drawing children\u2019s attention to texts and <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/lit.12003\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">parent-child bonding<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are many factors at play here; some of these are new to the digital format, some of these are the same as when reading printed books. For any reading format, the quality of the text as well as the need for language support parents can provide, are key. Conversely, some features are only possible with the digital format- such as, the possibility to audio-record some text passages or reading the same book with relatives via skype.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our project<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We want to make sure that parents, caregivers, educators and practitioners have access to the latest research evidence and develop a tool to share some inspirational practices. These efforts build on previous work and available resources in this area. Namely, the National Literacy Trust developed the digital evaluation tool \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/literacyapps.literacytrust.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Literacy Apps<\/a>\u201d which showcases high-quality digital books and reading\/writing apps for children.\u00a0It also builds on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x6Qf6cOQ7RI\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">panel discussion at RSA<\/a> in February 2016, which brought together insights from children\u2019s publishers, researchers, digital producers and UK\u2019s leading literacy charities.<\/p>\n<p>The \u00a32k <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thersa.org\/fellowship\/project-support\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RSA Catalyst Funding<\/a> will help us create an engaging video resource for parents and educators and to hold focus groups with parents and teachers local to Manchester. The project is also supported by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edlab.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EdLab<\/a> &#8211; an education lab at Manchester Metropolitan University that encourages MMU students to actively participate in the local community and engage in the design and delivery of educational projects.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article is reposted from The RSA website to increase reach.
