There is a growing body of research which suggests that art (and \u2018purpose\u2019 more broadly), adds meaning to abstract STEM learning. In turn, this renders it more accessible and raises the likelihood of successful engagement by learners.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Through this activity, we will grapple with a number of theoretical questions. These will include the ways in which art (and purpose, more broadly) adds meaning to abstract STEM learning, making it more accessible and therefore increasing engagement and understanding. There is also a growing realisation of the economic need to associate design with technology in order to ensure that function takes form. All of this is powerful, but it also situates Art in the service of STEM concepts (and, by proxy, economic needs). In this work, we will play with a inversion of this; what happens when technology instead becomes a series of materials to facilitate the production of art?<\/p>\n<p><strong>More information:<\/strong> To get involved in this project, or to work on a challenge which supports the development of this project, contact m.peace @mmu.ac.uk or edlab @mmu.ac.uk<\/p>\n<p><strong>Partner Name:<\/strong> Various \u2013 Primary and Secondary Schools, Public and Community Venues<br \/>\n<strong>Keywords:<\/strong> Art, STEM, Electronics, Creativity<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Explore ways in which simple materials such as copper tape and LEDs can be used as materials in the production of art, and develop ways in which this activity can form the basis of educational activity for children, young people and communities more widely.
