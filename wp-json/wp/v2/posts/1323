Investment in girls\u2019 education also has a multiplier effect: educated girls benefit from better family planning and have healthier children who are more likely to remain in education themselves. But Sierra Leonean girls are increasingly likely to drop out of school at this vital stage.<\/p>\n<p>Street-Child are a charity who work to address these issues. Juliet from Street-Child said that they are keen to work with MMU students to support their work. The challenge is to raise funds and awareness of the educational issues faced Sierra Leone.
