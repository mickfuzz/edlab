EdLab is a new MMU Faculty of Education initiative, in which students tackle \u2018real-world challenges\u2019 from the community. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we will work in partnership with community groups, charities, small enterprises and schools to design and put into action creative educational initiatives. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Our Aims<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>EdLab aims to be of value both to the community and to students. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do this we will work with partners and students \u00a0to develop creative and innovative educational solutions to real challenges that you face. This will in turn be invaluable experience for our students in understanding the contexts in which you work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In producing wider reaching impact we aim to create resources based upon the projects which can be used freely by anyone who wishes to access them. For example , by using video to document our processes and projects which will be shared on our website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EdLab \u00a0is guided by the principle of doing things and learning from them, because creative and innovative ideas are likely to spring from this process. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How it Works<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Set us an educational challenge \u00a0via our website, email, on the phone or in person. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will then put together an interdisciplinary team of students from our EdLab programme, and support them in creating delivering a solution. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the initial stages we work by organising a<\/span><b> \u2018creative space\u2019<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which you can meet with students to present your challenge. During this space we will support the generation of ideas, with the benefit of \u00a0immediate feedback from you on suitability and feasibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students and partners will then work together to enact the projects. Whilst staff at MMU will support this process, this will require input into the relationship with student from partners for example, by being responsive to communication from students. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the final stages we will work to capture and record the solutions to your challenges. This may also include documenting and sharing resources which can be used again by your own group, but also by others. Aspirationally, this process will result in productive and enjoyable relationships which may also lead to future development of the projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Example Projects<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Manchester Central Library has a number of under used spaces and resources, including a music library with drum kits and keyboards, and computers with state of the art software. Their challenge to EdLab was to draw in more families, children and young people to use these resources.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We arranged and supported a \u2018creative space\u2019 at MMU for our students to work directly with Paula from the Central Library in generating ideas. The first project we conducted in response to this challenge was a music and computer coding event called Sonic Pi , conducted in the library and attended by home educated children. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-height360 wp-image-590\" src=\"http:\/\/mcrblogs.co.uk\/edlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/64\/2015\/09\/IMG_4028-540x360.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4028\" width=\"540\" height=\"360\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Children and parents attending Sonic Pi sessions have given enthusiastic feedback: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sonic pi was a revelation, we\u2019ve been on it since we got home yesterday i am convinced it&#8217;s a great way to get people understanding code and creating music, it&#8217;s a brilliant tool and live_loop , wow<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are now working to develop further projects in the library, as well as extending the project to our PGCE music and I.T specialist students to build new activities. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What EdLab Offers to You<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EdLab offers you the chance to work in partnership with MMU staff and students to develop skills and create meaningful and valuable initiatives and resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who work in partnership with EdLab in supporting and leading projects will have the opportunity to benefit in the following ways;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-produced outcomes to challenges<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human Resources &#8211; knowledge, staff and student time <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Space at the University &#8211; partners can book University Rooms through us<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joint funding bids<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">APEL: masters degree credits for partners via Accreditation of Prior Experience Learning<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open lectures\/creative spaces<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources\/toolkits for sessions on website<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Good<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beneficial and Productive \u00a0University Contacts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good Publicity<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Next Steps<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact EdLab via email or social media:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edlab @mmu.ac.uk<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@edlabmmu<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a Nutshell EdLab is about creating and doing good stuff together.
