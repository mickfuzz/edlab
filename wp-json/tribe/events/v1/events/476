We\u2019ll be creating design fictions to explore how MMU can support the Manchester Hive in providing young people in Manchester with exciting opportunities to develop the digital skills they\u2019ll need to survive and thrive in the future.<\/p>\n<p>What if we gave every young person in Manchester a robot with a virus and they had to learn to re-programme it in order to save the robot\u2019s life? Would that work? Would it be too expensive? Would the young person be traumatised if they failed? Would it lead to back-of-the-playground robot wars competitions? These are the kinds of scenarios you can play out through design fictions but in the end we think through bigger questions such as what\u2019s it like to be young in a changing world, what do we owe children, how might we build stronger communities?<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/educationenrichment.wordpress.com\/events-list\/18951603757\/\">Open to all &#8211;
